And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true.Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.With this bold and deeply personal novel, It Ends With Us is a heart-wrenching story and an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price.Read more","['Fiction, Romance, Contemporary, Life change events', 'Triangles (Interpersonal relations)', 'Man-woman relationships', 'Neurosurgeons', 'First loves', 'Businesswomen', 'Fiction', 'Contemporary Women', 'New York Times bestseller', 'Fiction, romance, contemporary', 'Man-woman relationships, fiction', 'Fiction, women', 'collectionid:nyt2020s']",4.29,818

It,Stephen King,"From the Flap:It began for the Losers on a day in June of 1958, the day school let out for the summer. That was the day Henry Bowers carved the first letter of his name on Ben Hanscom's belly and chased him into the Barrens, the day Henry and his Neanderthal friends beat up on Stuttering Bill Denbrough and Eddie Kaspbrak, the day Stuttering Bill had to save Eddie from his worst asthma attack ever by riding his bike to beat the devil. It ended in August, with seven desperate children in search of a creature of unspeakable evil in the drains beneath Derry. In search of It. And somehow it ended.Or so they thought. Then.On a spring night in 1985 Mike Hanlon, once one of those children, makes six calls. Stan Uris, accountant. Richie ""Records"" Tozier, L.A. disc jockey. Ben Hanscom, renowned architect. Beverly Rogan, dress designer. Eddie Kaspbrak, owner of a successful New York limousine company. And Bill Denbrough, bestselling writer of horror novels. Bill Denbrough who now only stutters in his dreams.These six men and one woman have forgotten their childhoods, have forgotten the time when they were Losers . . . but an unremembered promise draws them back, the present begins to rhyme dreadfully with the past, and when the Losers reunite, the wheels of fate lock together and roll them toward the ultimate terror.In the biggest and most ambitious book of his career, Stephen King gives us not only his most towering epic of horror but a surprising reillumination of the corridor where we pass from the bright mysteries of childhood to those of maturity.Read more","['coming of age', 'thrillers', 'suspense', 'horror', 'Schwinn bicycles', 'catatonia', 'homosexuality', 'blood oaths', 'Omniscience', 'mummies', 'lepers', 'ghosts', 'we', 'clownrewolves', 'nonlinear narrative', 'third-person', 'Open Library Staff Picks', 'Fiction', 'Good and evil', 'horror stories', 'horror tales', 'Horror fiction', 'Reading Level-Grade 9', 'Reading Level-Grade 11', 'Reading Level-Grade 10', 'Reading Level-Grade 12', 'nyt:trade-fiction-paperback=2017-09-03', 'New York Times bestseller', 'New York Times reviewed', 'Fiction, horror', 'American literature']",4.14,392

Nineteen Eighty-Four,George Orwell,"Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel, often referred to as 1984, is a dystopian social science fiction novel by the English novelist George Orwell (the pen name of Eric Arthur Blair). It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, Nineteen Eighty-Four centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated.

I'm Glad My Mom Died,Jennette McCurdy,"Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother’s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called “calorie restriction,” eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, “Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn’t tint hers?” She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.In I’m Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail—just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true.

To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee,"One of the best-loved stories of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has been translated into more than 40 languages, sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormously popular motion picture, and voted one of the best novels of the 20th century by librarians across the United States. A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father -- a crusading local lawyer -- risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.Lawyer Atticus Finch defends Tom Robinson -- a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Writing through the young eyes of Finch's children Scout and Jem, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in small-town Alabama during the mid-1930s Depression years. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man's struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much.

The Psychology of Money,Morgan Housel,"Read This Book For Free Now👉 https://t.co/NYg83FnWrsTimeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness doing well with money isn’t necessarily about what you know. It’s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In the psychology of money, the author shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life’s most important matters.Read more","['Money', 'Consumption (Economics)', 'Quality of life', 'Attitude change', 'Accounting', 'Ethics', 'Self-help techniques', 'Psychology', 'Finance', 'Personal', 'Satisfaction', 'Wealth, management', 'Psychological aspects', 'Wealth', 'Personal Finance', 'Financial literacy', 'Management', 'Richesse', 'BUSINESS & ECONOMICS', 'Investing']",4.09,108

Often regarded as one of his best works, the novel presents a future American society where books are outlawed and ""firemen"" burn any that are found. The book's tagline explains the title as ""'the temperature at which book paper catches fire, and burns"": the autoignition temperature of paper. The lead character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who becomes disillusioned with his role of censoring literature and destroying knowledge, eventually quitting his job and committing himself to the preservation of literary and cultural writings.The novel has been the subject of interpretations focusing on the historical role of book burning in suppressing dissenting ideas for change. In a 1956 radio interview, Bradbury said that he wrote Fahrenheit 451 because of his concerns at the time (during the McCarthy era) about the threat of book burning in the United States. In later years, he described the book as a commentary on how mass media reduces interest in reading literature.In 1954, Fahrenheit 451 won the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature and the Commonwealth Club of California Gold Medal. It later won the Prometheus ""Hall of Fame"" Award in 1984 and a ""Retro"" Hugo Award, one of a limited number of Best Novel Retro Hugos ever given, in 2004. Bradbury was honored with a Spoken Word Grammy nomination for his 1976 audiobook version.

De animales a dioses : breve historia de la humanidad. - 1. ed.,Yuval Noah Harari,"El libro de no ficción del año. Bestseller internacional con más de diez millones de ejemplares vendidos. Número 1 en la lista de The New York Times. Recomendado por Barack Obama, Bill Gates y Mark Zuckerberg. De la mano de uno de los historiadores más interesantes de la actualidad, he aquí la fascinante interpretación de Yuval Noah Harari sobre la historia de la humanidad. Bestseller nacional e internacional, este libro explora las formas en que la biología y la historia nos han definido y han mejorado nuestra comprensión de lo que significa ser «humano». Hace 70.000 años al menos seis especies de humanos habitaban la Tierra. Hoy solo queda una, la nuestra: Homo Sapiens. ¿Cómo logró nuestra especie imponerse en la lucha por la existencia? ¿Por qué nuestros ancestros recolectores se unieron para crear ciudades y reinos? ¿Cómo llegamos a creer en dioses, en naciones o en los derechos humanos; a confiar en el dinero, en los libros o en las leyes? ¿Cómo acabamos sometidos a la burocracia, a los horarios y al consumismo? ¿Y cómo será el mundo en los milenios venideros? En Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari traza una breve historia de la humanidad, desde los primeros humanos que caminaron sobre la Tierra hasta los radicales y a veces devastadores avances de las tres grandes revoluciones que nuestra especie ha protagonizado: la cognitiva, la agrícola y la científica. A partir de hallazgos de disciplinas tan diversas como la biología, la antropología o la economía, Harari explora cómo las grandes corrientes de la historia han modelado nuestra sociedad, los animales y las plantas que nos rodean e incluso nuestras personalidades. ¿Hemos ganado en felicidad a medida que ha avanzado la historia? ¿Seremos capaces de liberar alguna vez nuestra conducta de la herencia del pasado? ¿Podemos hacer algo para influir en los siglos futuros? Audaz, ambicioso y provocador, este libro cuestiona todo lo que creíamos saber sobre el ser humano: nuestros orígenes, nuestras ideas, nuestras acciones, nuestro poder... y nuestro futuro. Reseñas:«El libro definitivo para entender quiénes somos. Provocador, lúcido, aporta un original enfoque sobre la esencia del ser humano.»Julia Navarro «Interesante y provocador. Este libro nos da cierta perspectiva del poco tiempo que llevamos en la Tierra, de la corta vida de la ciencia y la agricultura, y de por qué no debemos dar nada por sentado.»Barack Obama «Recomendaría este libro a cualquier persona interesada en una historia de la humanidad a la vez entretenida y desafiante [...] No se puede dejar de leer.»Bill Gates «Aborda las cuestiones más importantes de la historia y del mundo moderno y, además, está escrito con un estilo vívido e inolvidable.»Jared Diamond, premio Pulitzer y autor de Armas, gérmenes y acero «Un libro que invita a la reflexión.»Mark Zuckerberg «Un repaso absorbente de la peripecia humana, escrito con rigor e irreverencia ilustrada.»Antonio Muñoz Molina, El País «Un libro fascinante, como nuestra especie. Nos ayudará a saber de dónde venimos para decidir hacia dónde vamos. Recomiendo Sapiens casi antes que saludar. ¡Disfrútenlo!»Leonor Watling «Monumental, brillante, provocadora.»Pablo Jáuregui, El Mundo «Cuenta la historia del ser humano desde su origen hasta que se convirtió en el rey de la creación.»Iñaki Gabilondo «Me fascina la forma de pensar de este tipo.»Risto Mejide «El aclamado Sapiens de Yuval Noah Harari hace para la evolución humana lo que Brevísima historia del tiempo, de Hawking, hizo para la física [...], un excelente trabajo que perfila nuestra lenta emergencia y eventual dominación del planeta.»Forbes «Por fin alguien ha escrito un libro como este.»Sebastian JungerRead more","['Cronología histórica', 'Technology and civilization', 'Tecnología y civilización', 'Human beings', 'Historical Chronology', 'Historia universal', 'Historia', 'Civilization', 'Hombre', 'World history', 'History', 'Non-Fiction', 'Science', 'SCIENCE / Life Sciences / General', 'SCIENCE / General', 'SCIENCE / Life Sciences / Evolution', 'Weltgeschichte', 'Civilization, history', 'Chronology, historical', 'Chronologie historique', 'Technologie et civilisation', 'Histoire universelle', 'Histoire', 'Humans', 'Civilisation', 'Homme', 'nyt:combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction=2015-03-01', 'New York Times bestseller', 'Life Sciences', 'Evolution', 'General', 'Menschheit', 'Humanité', 'Människan', 'Fysisk antropologi', 'Human', 'Sapiens', 'nyt:paperback-nonfiction=2018-06-03', 'Comics & graphic novels, adaptations', 'Zivilisation', 'Society', 'Psychology', 'Economic history', 'Cognition and culture']",4.30,107
"Rollercoasters Wonder Reader [Paperback] Palacio, R.J",R. J. Palacio,"Wonder is a children's novel written by R. J. Palacio,[2] published on 14 February 2012.R. J. Palacio wrote Wonder after an incident where her son noticed a girl with a severe facial difference and started to cry. Fearing he would react badly, Palacio attempted to remove her son from the situation so as not to upset the girl and her family but ended up worsening the situation. Natalie Merchant's song of the same name made her realize that the incident could illustrate a valuable lesson. Palacio was inspired by Merchant's lyrics and she began writing. She named the book directly after the song and used the song's chorus as the prologue of the first chapter.Read more","['health', 'daily living', 'mainstreaming', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'young adult fiction', 'Mark Twain Award', 'Special Needs', 'Fiction - Social Themes - Special Needs', 'Diseases Illnesses & Injuries', 'Fiction - Health & Daily Living - Diseases Illnesses & Injuries', 'Fiction - School & Education', 'Self-acceptance', 'Human Abnormalities', 'Middle schools', 'New York Times bestseller', 'nyt:chapter_books=2012-02-25', 'Juvenile fiction', 'face abnormalities', 'personal beauty', 'body image', 'Spanish language materials', 'Escuelas', 'Padres e hijos', 'Aprobación de sí mismo', 'Divorcio', 'Deformidades', 'Ficción juvenil', 'Hermanos y hermanas', 'Psychology', 'Health & Daily Living', 'Divorce', 'School & Education', 'Disabled Children', 'Fiction', 'Private schools', 'Birth defects', 'Family Relations', 'Brothers and sisters', 'Parent and child', 'Students', 'Social Themes', 'Mainstreaming (Education)', 'Diseases, Illnesses & Injuries', 'Children with disabilities', 'Multiple Abnormalities', 'Schools', ""Children's fiction"", 'Self-acceptance, fiction', 'Schools, fiction', 'People with disabilities, fiction', 'Education Mainstreaming', 'Large type books', 'JUVENILE FICTION / Social Issues / Self-Esteem & Self-Reliance', 'Teasing', ""Children's audiobooks"", 'Imagination', 'JUVENILE FICTION / Health & Daily Living / Diseases', 'JUVENILE FICTION / School & Education', 'JUVENILE FICTION / Health & Daily Living / Daily Activities', 'New York Times reviewed', 'American fiction']",4.34,194
Where the crawdads sing,Delia Owens,"""For years, rumors of the ""Marsh Girl"" have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. She's barefoot and wild; unfit for polite society. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark. But Kya is not what they say. Abandoned at age ten, she has survived on her own in the marsh that she calls home. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life lessons from the land, learning from the false signals of fireflies the real way of this world. But while she could have lived in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world--until the unthinkable happens. In Where the Crawdads Sing, Owens juxtaposes an exquisite ode to the natural world against a heartbreaking coming of age story and a surprising murder investigation.""--Read more","['Solitude', 'Fiction', 'Fiction, coming of age', 'Fiction, mystery & detective, historical', 'North carolina, fiction', 'nyt:hardcover-fiction=2018-09-23', 'New York Times bestseller', 'Abandoned children', 'Man-woman relationships', 'Investigation', 'Young women', 'Murder', 'nyt:combined-print-and-e-book-fiction=2018-09-30', 'nyt:trade-fiction-paperback=2021-04-18', 'Women hermits', 'FICTION / Literary', 'FICTION / Coming of Age', 'FICTION / Contemporary Women', 'Coming of age', 'collectionid:nyt2020s']",4.38,68

"Thinking, fast and slow",Daniel Kahneman,"""The guru to the gurus at last shares his knowledge with the rest of us. Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman's seminal studies in behavioral psychology, behavioral economics, and happiness studies have influenced numerous other authors, including Steven Pinker and Malcolm Gladwell. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman at last offers his own, first book for the general public. It is a lucid and enlightening summary of his life's work. It will change the way you think about thinking. Two systems drive the way we think and make choices, Kahneman explains: System One is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System Two is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Examining how both systems function within the mind, Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities as well as the biases of fast thinking and the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and our choices. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, he shows where we can trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking, contrasting the two-system view of the mind with the standard model of the rational economic agent. Kahneman's singularly influential work has transformed cognitive psychology and launched the new fields of behavioral economics and happiness studies. In this path-breaking book, Kahneman shows how the mind works, and offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and personal lives--and how we can guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.""--Publisher.Read more","['Intuition', 'Thought and thinking', 'Reasoning', 'Decision making', 'New York Times bestseller', 'Long Now Manual for Civilization', 'Thinking', 'Kognition', '77.32 intelligence, creativity', 'New York Times reviewed', 'Reason', 'Cognition', 'Self-actualization (Psychology)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Psychology']",4.17,128

Brave New World,Aldous Huxley,"Originally published in 1932, this outstanding work of literature is more crucial and relevant today than ever before. Cloning, feel-good drugs, antiaging programs, and total social control through politics, programming, and media -- has Aldous Huxley accurately predicted our future?

The Handmaid's Tale,Margaret Atwood,"The Handmaid's Tale is not only a radical and brilliant departure for Margaret Atwood, it is a novel of such power that the reader will be unable to forget its images and its forecast. Set in the near future, it describes life in what was once the United States, now called the Republic of Gilead, a monotheocracy that has reacted to social unrest and a sharply declining birthrate by reverting to, and going beyond, the repressive intolerance of the original Puritans. The regime takes the Book of Genesis absolutely at its word, with bizarre consequences for the women and men of its population.The story is told through the eyes of Offred, one of the unfortunate Handmaids under the new social order. In condensed but eloquent prose, by turns cool-eyed, tender, despairing, passionate, and wry, she reveals to us the dark corners behind the establishment's calm facade, as certain tendencies now in existence are carried to their logical conclusions. The Handmaid's Tale is funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing. It is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and tour de force. It is Margaret Atwood at her best.   --front flapRead more","['brothels', 'Canadian authors', 'Canadian fantasy fiction', 'Canadian fiction (fictional works by one author)', 'Christian fundamentalism', 'Dystopian fiction', 'Dystopias', 'fantasy fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fiction, dystopian', 'Fiction, fantasy, general', 'handmaids', 'Large type books', 'Man-woman relationships', 'Man-woman relationships, fiction', 'military dictatorship', 'Misogyny', 'New York Times bestseller', 'nyt:e-book-fiction=2017-01-22', 'nyt:trade-fiction-paperback=2017-02-26', 'Old Testament', 'Political', 'political fiction', 'pregnancy', 'religious fanaticism', 'revolution', 'science fiction', 'Scrabble', 'Social aspects', 'theocracy', 'theonomy', 'totalitarianism', 'United States Congress', 'Women', 'Study guides', 'History and criticism', ""Handmaid's tale (Atwood, Margaret)"", 'Roman canadien de langue anglaise', 'Misogynie', 'collectionID:EanesChallenge', 'Romans, nouvelles', 'Femmes', 'collectionID:ConroeChallenge', 'FICTION / Dystopian', 'FICTION / Political', 'FICTION / Science Fiction']",3.88,72

Deep Work,Cal Newport,"One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare. If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.In DEEP WORK, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four ""rules,"" for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, DEEP WORK takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories -- from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air -- and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. DEEP WORK is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world.Read more","['Mental work', 'Distraction', 'Success', 'Cognition', 'Mental fatigue', 'BUSINESS & ECONOMICS / Time Management', 'Labor productivity', 'Employee motivation', 'Attention', 'Distraction (Psychology)', 'Success in business', 'Achievement', 'Commerce', 'Thinking']",3.94,101

Donald Keene, who translated this and Dazai's first novel, The Setting Sun, has said of the author's work: ""His world . . . suggests Chekhov or possibly postwar France, . . . but there is a Japanese sensibility in the choice and presentation of the material. A Dazai novel is at once immediately intelligible in Western terms and quite unlike any Western book.""

Little prince,Antoine de Saint-Exupéry,"Le Petit Prince est une œuvre de langue française, la plus connue d'Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. Publié en 1943 à New York simultanément à sa traduction anglaise, c'est une œuvre poétique et philosophique sous l'apparence d'un conte pour enfants.Traduit en quatre cent cinquante-sept langues et dialectes, Le Petit Prince est le deuxième ouvrage le plus traduit au monde après la Bible.Le langage, simple et dépouillé, parce qu'il est destiné à être compris par des enfants, est en réalité pour le narrateur le véhicule privilégié d'une conception symbolique de la vie. Chaque chapitre relate une rencontre du petit prince qui laisse celui-ci perplexe, par rapport aux comportements absurdes des « grandes personnes ». Ces différentes rencontres peuvent être lues comme une allégorie.Les aquarelles font partie du texte et participent à cette pureté du langage : dépouillement et profondeur sont les qualités maîtresses de l'œuvre.On peut y lire une invitation de l'auteur à retrouver l'enfant en soi, car « toutes les grandes personnes ont d'abord été des enfants. (Mais peu d'entre elles s'en souviennent.) ».

It doesn’t matter how beautiful or charming she is. He'll do everything in his power to destroy the evidence and their betrothal.

In The Power of Now he shows readers how to recognize themselves as the creators of their own pain, and how to have a pain-free existence by living fully in the present.

The Book Thief,Markus Zusak,"Erase una vez un mundo donde las noches eran largas y la Muerte contaba su propia historia. erase una vez una ladrona que robaba libros y regalaba palabras. En el pueblo vivia una nina que queria leer, un hombre que tocaba el acordeon y un joven judio que escribia cuentos hermosos para escapar del horror de la guerra.

The lord of the rings,J.R.R. Tolkien,"Originally published from 1954 through 1956, J.R.R. Tolkien's richly complex series ushered in a new age of epic adventure storytelling. A philologist and illustrator who took inspiration from his work, Tolkien invented the modern heroic quest novel from the ground up, creating not just a world, but a domain, not just a lexicon, but a language, that would spawn countless imitators and lead to the inception of the epic fantasy genre. Today, THE LORD OF THE RINGS is considered ""the most influential fantasy novel ever written."" (THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FANTASY)During his travels across Middle-earth, the hobbit Bilbo Baggins had found the Ring. But the simple band of gold was far from ordinary; it was in fact the One Ring - the greatest of the ancient Rings of Power. Sauron, the Dark Lord, had infused it with his own evil magic, and when it was lost, he was forced to flee into hiding.But now Sauron's exile has ended and his power is spreading anew, fueled by the knowledge that his treasure has been found. He has gathered all the Great Rings to him, and will stop at nothing to reclaim the One that will complete his dominion. The only way to stop him is to cast the Ruling Ring deep into the Fire-Mountain at the heart of the land of Mordor--Sauron's dark realm.Fate has placed the burden in the hands of Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's heir...and he is resolved to bear it to its end. Or his own.ContainsThe Fellowship of the RingThe Two TowersThe Return of the KingThe Lord of the Rings [2/2]The Lord of the Rings [1/6]The Lord of the Rings [1/9]The Lord of the Rings [2/9]The Lord of the Rings [3/9]Read more","['The Lord of the Rings', 'Fiction', 'Ficción', 'English Fantasy fiction', 'Ficción fantástica inglesa', 'Fantasy fiction', 'Fiction in English', 'Open Library Staff Picks', 'Middle Earth (Imaginary place)', 'Fiction, fantasy, epic', 'Middle earth (imaginary place), fiction', 'Baggins, frodo (fictitious character), fiction', 'Gandalf (fictitious character), fiction', 'British and irish fiction (fictional works by one author)', 'English literature', 'Frodo Baggins (Fictitious character)', 'Baggins, bilbo (fictitious character), fiction', 'Fiction, fantasy, general', 'English language', 'Fiction, media tie-in', 'Gift books', 'Quests (Expeditions)', 'Wizards', 'Terre du Milieu (Lieu imaginaire)', 'Romans, nouvelles', 'Quête']",4.52,65

But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as told in The Hobbit. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.Read more","['Elves', 'Dwarves', 'evil', 'fear', 'friends', 'hope', 'young adult fiction', 'Ficción', 'Ficción fantástica inglesa', 'Fantastic fiction', 'The Lord of the Rings', 'English Fantasy fiction', 'Open Library Staff Picks', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fairy tales', 'Adventure stories', 'Fantasy fiction', 'Middle Earth (Imaginary place)', 'History and criticism', 'FICTION / Fantasy / Epic', 'Adventure fiction', 'English fiction', 'Translations in Chinese', 'Fiction, fantasy, epic', 'Middle earth (imaginary place), fiction', 'Baggins, frodo (fictitious character), fiction', 'Gandalf (fictitious character), fiction', 'British and irish fiction (fictional works by one author)', 'Baggins, bilbo (fictitious character), fiction', 'Fiction, media tie-in', ""Children's fiction"", 'English literature', 'Large type books', 'Fiction in English', 'Roman', 'Français (langue)', 'Lectures et morceaux choisis', 'Vol. 1.', 'Lord of the rings (Tolkien, J.R.R.)', 'Gandolf (Fictitious character)', 'Terre du Milieu (Lieu imaginaire)', 'Romans, nouvelles', 'Frodo Baggins (Fictitious character)', 'Fiction, fantasy, general']",4.34,278

The pair seems unstoppable until tragedy strikes and their hopes come crashing down, forcing George to make a difficult decision regarding the welfare of his best friend.The novel is set on a ranch in Soledad, CA. Author Frank Bergon recalls reading Of Mice and Men for the first time as a teenager living in the San Joaquin Valley and remembers how he saw “as if in a jolt of light the ordinary surroundings of [his] life become worthy of literature.” Steinbeck works to propagate the notion that meaningful stories emerge from the marginalized; that even those on the fringes of society can make deserving contributions to the literary canon.Source: http://www.steinbeck.org/about-john/his-works/   Also contained in:    - Cannery Row / Of Mice and Men    - Grapes of Wrath / The Moon is Down / Cannery Row / East of Eden / Of Mice and Men    - Novels and Stories 1932-1937    - Short Novels of John Steinbeck    - Steinbeck    - Steinbeck Pocket BookRead more","['contemporary fiction', 'literary fiction', 'classics', 'Labor Trilogy', 'psychological fiction', 'Male friendship', 'Goal (Psychology)', 'western stories', 'Fiction', 'Vida ranchera', 'Men', 'People with mental disabilities', 'Classic Literature', 'Ranch life', 'Drifters', 'Retrasados mentales', 'Open Library Staff Picks', 'Vaqueros', 'open_syllabus_project', 'Friendship', 'Amistad entre hombres', 'Cowboys', 'Ficción', 'Literary', 'Small Town & Rural', 'Cowhands', 'Farm life', 'Cow-boys', 'Vie rurale', 'Classical literature', 'Roman', 'Amitié masculine', 'Historical fiction', 'American fiction (fictional works by one author)', 'California, fiction', ""Children's fiction"", 'Voyages and travels, fiction', 'People with disabilities, fiction', 'Friendship, fiction', 'Fiction, general', 'West (u.s.), fiction', 'Large type books', 'American literature', 'Critique et interprétation', 'Littérature française', 'Étude et enseignement', 'Fiction, fantasy, general', 'Study guides', 'Examinations', 'Comic books, strips', 'Of mice and men (Steinbeck, John)', 'American fiction', 'Roman américain', 'Romans, nouvelles', 'Personnes ayant une déficience intellectuelle', 'Vie au ranch', 'Migrant labor', 'Drama', 'American drama (dramatic works by one author)', 'Fiction, psychological', 'collectionID:bannedbooks']",3.97,200
Divergent,Veronica Roth,"‘Divergent’ is the first in a trilogy of dystopian, YA novels by Veronica Roth. The book is written from Beatrice Prior’s (Tris), point of view and is written in short chapters making it easy to put down and pick up again.The story is fast paced with full on action throughout. It contains elements of humour and romance, alongside some seriously brutal scenes, especially during Tris’s initiation. There is also quite a few though provoking moments.This was one of the first YA novels that I read and I found myself hooked right through to the very last word.The scenes are described in detail giving you a clear picture and making it easy to visualise the on goings in your head.Tris can be a little moody at times and doubts herself too much, but this only adds to her good nature, fun, determined and strong personality which we see blossom throughoutThe ending wasn’t what I expected, thus my need to get the second book, ‘Insurgent’, straight away. I Needed to know what happened next.I surprisingly found myself enjoying Divergent much more than I first thought I would, and thus my love of YA novels began.Divergent was made into a movie back in 2014. If you have seen the film but not read the book then you are missing out on vital aspects of the plot and characters, that didn’t appear in the film. I enjoyed the film, just not as much as the book.Read more","['New York Times bestseller', 'nyt:paperback_books=2012-02-25', 'Families', 'Family', 'Juvenile fiction', 'Social classes', 'Courage', 'Fiction', 'Identity', 'Identity (Psychology)', 'Dystopias', ""Children's fiction"", 'Identity, fiction', 'Family, fiction', 'Courage, fiction', 'Science fiction', 'dystopian', 'young adult', 'dystopian fiction', 'sci-fi', 'YA', 'dystopian YA', 'bestseller', 'future', 'Family life', 'Identity (Philosophical concept)', 'YOUNG ADULT FICTION', 'Romance', 'Individuality', 'Social Themes', 'Values & Virtues', 'Reading Level-Grade 7', 'Reading Level-Grade 9', 'Reading Level-Grade 8', 'Reading Level-Grade 11', 'Reading Level-Grade 10', 'Reading Level-Grade 12', 'Large type books', 'Valentía', 'Spanish language materials', 'Familia', 'Ficción', 'Clases sociales', 'Identidad (Psicología)']",4.00,138

Ender's game,Orson Scott Card,"Ender's Game is a 1985 military science fiction novel by American author Orson Scott Card. Set at an unspecified date in Earth's future, the novel presents an imperiled humankind after two conflicts with the Formics, an insectoid alien species they dub the ""buggers"". In preparation for an anticipated third invasion, children, including the novel's protagonist, Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin, are trained from a very young age by putting them through increasingly difficult games, including some in zero gravity, where Ender's tactical genius is revealed.The book originated as a short story of the same name, published in the August 1977 issue of Analog Science Fiction and Fact. The novel was published on January 15, 1985. Later, by elaborating on characters and plotlines depicted in the novel, Card was able to write additional books in the Ender's Game series. Card also released an updated version of Ender's Game in 1991, changing some political facts to reflect the times more accurately (e.g., to include the recent collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War). The novel has been translated into 34 languages.Reception of the book has been mostly positive. It has become suggested reading for many military organizations, including the United States Marine Corps. Ender's Game was recognized as ""best novel"" by the 1985 Nebula Award[3] and the 1986 Hugo Award[4] in the genres of science fiction and fantasy. Its four sequels—Speaker for the Dead (1986), Xenocide (1991), Children of the Mind (1996), and Ender in Exile (2008)—follow Ender's subsequent travels to many different worlds in the galaxy. In addition, the later novella A War of Gifts (2007) and novel Ender's Shadow (1999), plus other novels in the Shadow saga, take place during the same time period as the original.Contained in:Ender's War   See also:Ender's Game: 1/2Read more","['military education', 'end of the world', 'prize:nebula', 'hegemony', 'space warfare', 'child soldiers', 'The Ender Quintet', 'science fiction', 'automation', 'data processing', 'aliens', 'Military art and science', 'Hermanos', 'Maniobras de guerra', 'Brothers and sisters', 'nyt:mass_market_paperback=2011-07-30', 'Open Library Staff Picks', 'Genetic engineering', 'Fiction', 'Hugo Award Winner', 'award:hugo_award=novel', 'Ficción', 'Ciencia-ficción', 'award:hugo_award=1986', 'War games', 'New York Times bestseller', 'Long Now Manual for Civilization', 'American Science fiction', ""Children's stories, American"", 'Artificial intelligence', 'Ender Wiggin (Fictitious character)', 'Reading Level-Grade 7', 'Reading Level-Grade 9', 'Reading Level-Grade 8', 'Reading Level-Grade 11', 'Reading Level-Grade 10', 'Reading Level-Grade 12', 'Wiggin, ender (fictitious character), fiction', 'Battle school (imaginary place), fiction', 'Fiction, science fiction, hard science fiction', 'Brothers and sisters, fiction', 'Science-Fiction-Literatur', 'Krieg', 'Amerikanisches Englisch', 'Außerirdische Intelligenz', 'award:nebula_award=novel', 'Peter Wiggin (Fictitious character)', 'Siblings, fiction']",4.32,309

Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed. Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern -- and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year. An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees -- how they approach worker safety -- and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones. What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. They succeeded by transforming habits. In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warrens Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nations largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death. At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. Habits arent destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives. - Publisher.Read more","['Social aspects', 'Habit', 'Change (Psychology)', 'New York Times bestseller', 'nyt:combined_print_nonfiction=2012-03-03', 'Popular Works', 'Habits', 'Psychological Adaptation', 'Behavior', 'Habit breaking', 'Mental Processes', 'Organizational Innovation', 'Life Change Events', 'Psychology', 'Aspect social', 'Verhaltensmodifikation', 'Béhaviorisme (psychologie)', 'Habitudes', 'Gewohnheit', 'Psychologie', 'Change (psychology)', 'Conduct of life', 'Aspectos sociales', 'Cambio (Psicologi a)', 'Self-realization', 'Ha bito', 'Hábito', 'Cambio (Psicología)', 'Organizational behavior', 'New York Times reviewed', 'Neuropsychology', 'Organizational Behavior', 'Social Psychology', 'Personal Growth']",3.94,83

Think Like a Monk,Jay Shetty,"Jay Shetty, social media superstar and host of the #1 podcast On Purpose, distills the timeless wisdom he learned as a monk into practical stepsWhen you think like a monk, you’ll understand:     How to overcome negativity     How to stop overthinking     Why comparison kills love     How to use your fear     Why you can’t find happiness by looking for it     How to learn from everyone you meet     Why you are not your thoughts     How to find your purpose     Why kindness is crucial to success     And much more... Shetty grew up in a family where you could become one of three things—a doctor, a lawyer, or a failure. His family was convinced he had chosen option three: instead of attending his college graduation ceremony, he headed to India to become a monk, to meditate every day for four to eight hours, and devote his life to helping others. After three years, one of his teachers told him that he would have more impact on the world if he left the monk’s path to share his experience and wisdom with others. Heavily in debt, and with no recognizable skills on his résumé, he moved back home in north London with his parents.Shetty reconnected with old school friends—many working for some of the world’s largest corporations—who were experiencing tremendous stress, pressure, and unhappiness, and they invited Shetty to coach them on well-being, purpose, and mindfulness.

Combining ancient wisdom and his own rich experiences in the ashram, Think Like a Monk reveals how to overcome negative thoughts and habits, and access the calm and purpose that lie within all of us. He transforms abstract lessons into advice and exercises we can all apply to reduce stress, improve relationships, and give the gifts we find in ourselves to the world. Shetty proves that everyone can—and should—think like a monk.Read more","['Self-help', 'nyt:advice-how-to-and-miscellaneous=2020-09-27', 'New York Times bestseller', 'Self-realization', 'Meaning (psychology)', 'Conduct of life', 'Hinduism', 'Monastic and religious life']",4.02,50
And Then There Were None,Agatha Christie,"And Then There Were None is a mystery novel by the English writer Agatha Christie, described by her as the most difficult of her books to write. It was first published in the United Kingdom by the Collins Crime Club on 6 November 1939, as Ten Little Niggers, after the children's counting rhyme and minstrel song, which serves as a major element of the plot. A US edition was released in January 1940 with the title And Then There Were None, which is taken from the last five words of the song. All successive American reprints and adaptations use that title, except for the Pocket Books paperbacks published between 1964 and 1986, which appeared under the title Ten Little Indians. UK editions continued to use the original title until the current definitive title appeared with a reprint of the 1963 Fontana Paperback in 1985.In 1990 Crime Writers' Association ranked And Then There Were None 19th in their The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time list. In 1995 in a similar list Mystery Writers of America ranked the novel 10th. In September 2015, to mark her 125th birthday, And Then There Were None was named the ""World's Favourite Christie"" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate. In the ""Binge!"" article of Entertainment Weekly Issue #1343-44 (26 December 2014–3 January 2015), the writers picked And Then There Were None as an ""EW favorite"" on the list of the ""Nine Great Christie Novels"".

His whole life has been one big non-event, and his obsession with famous last words has only made him crave “the Great Perhaps” even more (Francois Rabelais, poet). He heads off to the sometimes crazy and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the hall is Alaska Young. The gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy, self-destructive, screwed up, and utterly fascinating Alaska Young. She is an event unto herself.

Steve Jobs,Walter Isaacson,"""From the author of the bestselling biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein, this is the exclusive biography of Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies around the world are trying to build digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple's hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.""--Read more","['TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING / General', 'History', 'Inc Apple Computer', 'BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Business', 'Computer engineers', 'Businesspeople', 'Biography', 'BUSINESS & ECONOMICS / General', 'New York Times bestseller', 'nyt:hardcover_business_books=2012-02-25', 'Chief executive officers', 'TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING', 'Life Change Events', 'Biographies', 'Businessmen', 'Autoformation', 'Business', ""Développement d'aptitudes"", 'General', 'BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY', 'Relations humaines', 'Computer industry', 'BUSINESS & ECONOMICS', 'Reading Level-Grade 11', 'Reading Level-Grade 12', 'Apple computer, inc.', 'Jobs, steve, 1955-2011', 'Businesspeople, biography', 'Large type books', 'Negociantes', 'Ingenieros', 'Biografía', 'Ingenieros en computación', 'Empresarios', 'Industria de computadoras', 'Historia', 'nyt:combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction=2011-11-13', 'New York Times reviewed', 'nyt:paperback-nonfiction=2013-09-29', 'Success in business', 'Leadership', 'Liderazgo', 'Apple Computers', 'University of Berkeley', 'Celebrities', 'Informaticiens', 'Apple Computer', 'Histoire', 'Chefs de direction', 'Vietnamese language materials', ""Gens d'affaires"", 'Qi ye jia', 'Zhuan ji', 'Événements stressants de la vie', 'BUSINESS & ECONOMICS/Leadership/', 'BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY/Business/', 'COMPUTERS/History/', 'Science & Technology', 'Mechanical', 'Apple Computer Inc']",4.06,121
